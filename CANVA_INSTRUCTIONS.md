## Naming Convention for Matching

After export and rename, the system works like this:

| Filename | Matches Post # | Has Text? |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| 01.png | Post 1 | No |
| 02.png | Post 2 | No |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 08.png | Post 8 | YES - "More treatment. No less depression." |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 14.png | Post 14 | YES - Dr. Powell-Williams |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Important**: Images with text overlays (08, 09, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 29) MUST match their corresponding posts in the CSV.

Generic images (all others) could theoretically be swapped, but keeping them numbered maintains organization.
