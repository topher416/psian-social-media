## Post 1: AI Can't Replace Human Therapy
**Source**: Ben Schwartz, 6/6/2025
**Original Platform**: Instagram
**Theme**: Human psychology complexity, AI limitations

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
Human psychology is immensely complex, nuanced, and often contradictory, with significant portions operating outside conscious awareness. AI, even advanced language models, operates on algorithms and data. While it can process language, it lacks true intuition, lived experience, and the capacity to grasp the intricate nature of human emotional life.

At PsiAN, we believe that therapies of depth, insight, and relationship aim to understand and resolve the underlying psychological conflicts and patterns that give rise to symptoms. The goal is not just symptom reduction but profound personal growth and healthier ways of relating to self and others.

Human psychology is immensely complex—nuanced, often contradictory, and operating largely outside conscious awareness. AI, including advanced language models, processes data and language, but lacks true intuition, lived experience, and the capacity to grasp the intricate nature of human emotional life.

At the Psychotherapy Action Network (PsiAN), we advocate for therapies of depth, insight, and relationship: approaches that address underlying psychological patterns rather than just managing symptoms. The goal is profound personal growth, improved self-understanding, and healthier ways of relating to ourselves and others.

## Post 2: AI Therapy Risks - Unconscious
**Source**: Ben Schwartz, 6/6/2025
**Original Platform**: Instagram
**Theme**: AI limitations with unconscious, data privacy

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
Considering AI for mental health support? Be aware of the limitations, especially when it comes to accessing the unconscious mind.

AI can mimic empathy, but it cannot truly understand the complex, often hidden motivations and conflicts that drive our feelings. This can lead to superficial "solutions" and potentially dangerous responses during crises.

Without a human therapist to navigate these dynamics, vital insights and true relational healing are missed. And ethical concerns over data privacy remain significant.

Considering AI for mental health support? It's worth understanding the significant limitations—particularly when it comes to accessing unconscious processes.

AI can simulate empathy, but it cannot truly comprehend the complex, often hidden motivations and conflicts that shape our emotional lives. This limitation can result in superficial interventions and, in crisis situations, potentially harmful responses.

Without a skilled human therapist to recognize and work through these deeper dynamics, opportunities for genuine insight and relational healing are lost. Additionally, substantial ethical concerns around data privacy persist in this space.

At PsiAN, we advocate for evidence-based therapies that prioritize depth, insight, and the therapeutic relationship. Learn more about what research shows leads to lasting change.

Thinking about AI for mental health? Here's what you should know about the risks, especially around deeper psychological work: 🧵

**comment1**:
AI can mimic empathy, but it can't access the unconscious—the hidden motivations and conflicts driving your feelings. This leads to surface-level "solutions" at best.

**comment2**:
In a crisis, AI responses can be inadequate or even dangerous. There's no trained human judgment assessing risk in real-time.

**comment3**:
True relational healing requires a human relationship. The therapeutic bond itself is part of the medicine. AI can't replicate that.

**comment4**:
Plus, data privacy concerns are real. Your deepest struggles shouldn't be training data. Learn more at @PsiikiAN

## Post 4: Mental Health Apps Privacy

**Theme**: Apps aren't replacements, HIPAA concerns

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
Mental health apps: Convenient, but are they enough?

Technology can assist, but apps cannot fully replace the nuanced connection of human-to-human therapy. While they may be useful tools for some purposes, apps are not replacements for therapists.

Many mental health apps also operate outside of HIPAA regulations, giving them more leeway in handling user data. Reports indicate that numerous apps collect and share sensitive information—including mental health symptoms, personal details, and usage patterns—with data brokers and advertisers.

The drive for profit can overshadow user privacy and ethical considerations. Let's use tech wisely.

**Link**: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-mental-health-apps-need-to-take-privacy-more-seriously/

### LinkedIn Version
Mental health apps offer convenience, but they come with significant limitations and risks that deserve consideration.

First, apps cannot replicate the nuanced, relational aspects of human-to-human therapy. While they may serve as supplementary tools, they are not replacements for trained therapists.

Second, many mental health apps operate outside HIPAA regulations, allowing greater latitude in how they handle sensitive user data. Research from the Brookings Institution documents how numerous apps collect and share mental health symptoms, personal details, and usage patterns with data brokers and advertisers.

When profit motives overshadow privacy and ethics, users bear the risk. As mental health professionals, we have a responsibility to help clients make informed decisions about the tools they use.

**comment1**:
Apps can't replace the nuanced connection of human therapy. They might help with basics, but they're not therapists.

**comment2**:
Here's the bigger issue: many mental health apps operate OUTSIDE of HIPAA. That means fewer protections for your sensitive data.

**comment3**:
Reports show apps sharing your mental health symptoms, personal details, and usage patterns with data brokers and advertisers. Your struggles become their product.

**comment4**:
The profit motive can overshadow privacy. Before using any mental health app, research their data practices. And remember: human connection heals. @PsiikiAN

## Post 5: Long-Term Therapy Benefits

**Original Platform**: Instagram
**Theme**: Depth therapy, lasting change, therapeutic alliance

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
Healing isn't a quick fix. It's a journey.

Long-term, depth-based therapy allows for deep exploration, lasting change, and building a truly resilient self. True growth comes from understanding the roots of our patterns, building healthier connections, and embracing our authentic selves.

PsiAN believes the work extends beyond symptom management. Depth-oriented psychotherapy fosters lasting change by addressing core relational patterns:

• Understanding the impact of past experiences
• Building secure attachment
• Developing emotional regulation
• Cultivating self-awareness

Research consistently shows that the quality of the therapeutic relationship is one of the strongest predictors of successful outcomes.

## Post 6: Rome Wasn't Built in a Day

**Theme**: Depth psychology advocacy, time for healing

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
"Rome wasn't built in a day." "Old habits die hard." "All in good time."

The wisdom of these sayings is obvious—so why wouldn't they apply to therapy as well?

It's understandable to want a quick fix to psychological problems. No one wants to prolong their distress. But quick fixes work for the moment, not the long haul.

At PsiAN, we advocate for depth psychology: treatment that examines early experiences and how they impact your current behavior, thoughts, feelings, and relationships. Understanding how persistent patterns came to be—and working through how they affect your life—is the most effective path to lasting change.

They say Rome wasn't built in a day. You weren't built in a day either. It takes time to achieve mental wellness, but it's time well spent.

We accept this wisdom in many areas of life—yet when it comes to mental health treatment, there's often pressure to find quick solutions. It's understandable. No one wants to prolong psychological distress.

But quick fixes are designed for the moment, not for lasting change.

## Post 7: Long-Term Therapy Research

**Original Platform**: LinkedIn
**Theme**: Research citations on long-term therapy benefits

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
Working with a therapist over an extended period can lead to lasting, positive changes for many people.

While short-term therapy has benefits, research tells a compelling story:

One study found that those in long-term therapy experienced "larger and more sustained benefits" with improved self-concept and personality functioning.

Another study found that compared to short-term therapy, longer-term treatment was associated with higher remission rates, greater work ability improvements, and significantly better symptom reduction.

## Post 8: Gold Standard Misinformation Thread
**Source**: David Drustrup, 3/13/2025
**Original Platform**: X/Twitter
**Theme**: Short-term therapy limitations, research paradox

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
The term "gold standard" in therapy is often misleading—and it primarily benefits insurance companies at the expense of patients.

Recent research titled "More treatment but no less depression: The treatment-prevalence paradox" describes a puzzling finding: increased availability of short-term therapies hasn't reduced depression rates.

This isn't surprising to depth therapists who understand that relational problems developed over years or decades require more than a few weeks to meaningfully address.

The researchers themselves acknowledge that benefits from short-term treatments are often modest, rarely sustained, and don't translate well to real-world settings.

Therapies of depth, insight, and relationship address deeper emotional patterns, fostering lasting transformation. Research shows patients in these therapies continue improving for years after treatment ends.

Choosing depth-oriented therapy means investing in meaningful, enduring emotional wellbeing—not just temporary relief.

#TherapyThatSticks #depthpsychology #mentalhealth #PsiAN

### LinkedIn Version
The term "gold standard" in therapy research deserves scrutiny—and understanding who benefits from promoting it.

Recent research titled "More treatment but no less depression: The treatment-prevalence paradox" (Ormel et al., 2022) highlights a significant finding: despite increased availability of short-term, symptom-focused treatments, depression prevalence hasn't decreased.

This paradox isn't surprising to depth-oriented clinicians. Relational problems and patterns that developed over years or decades logically require more than a few weeks to meaningfully address.

Notably, the study authors—some of whom advocate for short-term methods—acknowledge that benefits from these treatments are often modest, rarely sustained, and don't generalize well to real-world clinical settings.

The "gold standard" label often obscures a more complex reality: while brief interventions may produce measurable short-term effects in controlled trials, therapies of depth, insight, and relationship produce change that compounds over time. Research consistently shows patients continue improving for years after such treatment ends.

The question isn't which approach produces faster results—it's which produces lasting ones.

## Post 9: Apps & Mental Health - Long Post
**Source**: Lisa Juliano, 3/30/2025
**Original Platform**: Facebook
**Theme**: 6-point breakdown of therapy app problems

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
Thinking about using a therapy app? Here's what you should know before taking that step:

1. Apps like BetterHelp and TalkSpace are tech companies first, mental health practices second. Their priority is platform expansion; mental health is the product.

2. "24/7 therapist access" sounds appealing, but research shows it's not therapeutic. Consistency—same person, same time, same place—creates the safety essential for real therapeutic work.

3. Effective psychotherapy relies on two things: a consistent relationship with and trust in your therapist. That's difficult with anonymous, potentially changing "therapists."

4. These platforms have the potential to share your data with third parties to serve their growth. Your struggles may become their business asset.

5. App-based therapy is limited in what it can address. They're not equipped for serious mental health crises, and sometimes operate contrary to best practices.

6. Research supports the efficacy of long-term, relationship-based psychotherapy. Most people seeking therapy want a lasting solution with an in-person therapist.

If you're ready to start therapy with a safe, consistent, effective approach, visit PsiAN.org for resources.

### LinkedIn Version
Before choosing a therapy app, consider these important factors:

**1. Business model clarity**: Platforms like BetterHelp and TalkSpace are primarily technology companies. Their core directive is market expansion; mental health services are the product offering.

**2. The "24/7 access" myth**: While constant availability sounds appealing, research indicates it's not therapeutically beneficial. Effective therapy relies on consistency—same clinician, regular scheduling—which creates the psychological safety necessary for meaningful work.

**3. The relationship foundation**: Effective psychotherapy depends on two elements: a consistent therapeutic relationship and trust in your therapist. These are difficult to establish with anonymous, potentially rotating providers.

**4. Data considerations**: These platforms may share user data with third parties to support growth objectives. Sensitive mental health information deserves stronger protections.

**5. Scope limitations**: App-based services are limited in the conditions they address and aren't equipped for serious mental health crises. Some practices may contradict clinical best practices.

**6. What research shows**: Evidence supports the efficacy of long-term, relationship-based psychotherapy. Our research indicates most people seeking therapy want lasting solutions with consistent, in-person treatment.

In addition to destigmatizing psychotherapy, PsiAN has taken on the challenge of shedding light on injustices perpetrated by insurance companies in mental health treatment.

Whether it's clawing back payments, demanding confidential patient notes, or creating complex administrative systems, these companies are driving psychologists out of insurance networks—which ultimately reduces patient access to care.

This is unacceptable, and something PsiAN is actively fighting. But we need your help.

Join, donate, or volunteer with PsiAN and help us push back against the practices insurance companies use to deny or limit life-saving mental health treatment.

Beyond destigmatizing psychotherapy, the Psychotherapy Action Network (PsiAN) works to address systemic injustices in how insurance companies handle mental health treatment.

The patterns are well-documented: clawing back payments months after services were rendered, demanding access to confidential patient notes, and creating administrative systems so complex that many providers simply give up. The result? Psychologists leaving insurance networks, and patients losing access to care.

This is a systemic problem requiring collective action.

This matters because authentic therapy requires a real human relationship: a trained professional who can truly understand your unique experience and provide consistent, ethical care within established clinical and legal frameworks.

At PsiAN, we advocate for therapy built on depth, insight, and genuine connection. We're committed to helping the public navigate an increasingly complicated mental health landscape.

Some AI chatbots are presenting themselves as licensed therapists—complete with fabricated credentials and license numbers that don't check out.

They promise better outcomes, 24/7 availability, and improved mental health. But they cannot replace what research consistently shows matters most: a trusted, consistent relationship with a real human therapist.

A leading voice in clinical psychology, Dr. Tummala-Narra brilliantly integrates psychoanalytic theory with multicultural psychology. Her research illuminates how race, immigration, and trauma profoundly shape mental well-being and identity.

Dr. Tummala-Narra's advocacy for culturally informed psychoanalytic psychotherapy aligns with PsiAN's mission for human-centered therapies that focus on depth, insight, and relationships. Her work reminds us why understanding unconscious processes within a broad social context is crucial for equitable mental healthcare.

As she states in "Advancing Psychotherapy for the Next Generation": "It is my hope that psychoanalysis moves in the direction of conceptualizing the specifics of diversity and diverse contexts as essential components that shape the psyche."

**Original Platform**: Facebook
**Original Issue**: "In honor of May being Mental Health Awareness Month"

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
At PsiAN, we believe the most effective therapies are those that emphasize insight, depth, and the therapeutic relationship.

Insight leads to breaking old patterns and creating new, more adaptive ones.

Depth addresses the root causes of mental distress, not just symptoms.

Relationship with your therapist—in a trusting, consistent, compassionate, and confidential environment—supports both insight and depth work.

Visit PsiAN.org to learn more about our mission and how to find quality care.

### LinkedIn Version
At the Psychotherapy Action Network (PsiAN), we advocate for therapeutic approaches grounded in three core elements:

**Insight** leads to recognition and transformation of long-standing patterns, creating space for more adaptive ways of being.

**Depth** addresses root causes of mental distress rather than surface-level symptom management.

**Relationship** with a therapist—characterized by trust, consistency, compassion, and confidentiality—creates the conditions where insight and depth work become possible.

These aren't abstract preferences. Research consistently demonstrates that these factors predict positive, lasting therapeutic outcomes.

Research consistently shows that therapies of depth, insight, and relationship are evidence-based treatments highly effective in both short and long term.

Decades of research also demonstrate that effective therapy takes time. Meaningful change typically begins around the six-month mark and only increases from there.

It's more important than ever to look past ads and corporate messaging. For many companies, shorter treatment means lower costs—regardless of patient outcomes.

Many insurance companies don't seem pleased that more people are seeking out psychotherapy.

The reach of insurers into the therapy room has been expanding for years: narrowly defining "evidence-based therapy," rationing care through "value-based care" models, leaving therapists between a rock and a hard place.

Either play by the rules of billion-dollar companies whose main goal is profit, or provide care the ethical way you were trained to.

## Post 22: Depth Therapy Threads Post 1 (David, 8/12)
**Source**: David Drustrup
**Original Platform**: X/Twitter

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
Therapies of depth, insight, and relationship start with a simple, human premise: our most troubling beliefs once protected us. They were solutions to real conditions, often in family or developmental contexts.

Instead of debating those beliefs in the present, we ask: "When did they begin? With whom? What did they help you survive?" This lens invites compassion and curiosity rather than shame.

In a steady therapeutic relationship, these answers are felt and experienced—something far more powerful than cognitive understanding alone. Old expectations are reworked in real time, offering new experiences of safety, repair, and choice.

Insight grows from this process: the old belief made sense, so it no longer needs harsh judgment. And it no longer has to run the show. That relief opens the door to lasting change.

#depthpsychology #therapy #mentalhealth #insight #PsiAN

### LinkedIn Version
Therapies of depth, insight, and relationship begin with a fundamentally human premise: our most troubling beliefs and patterns once served protective functions. They were solutions to real conditions—often in family systems or developmental contexts.

Rather than debating these beliefs in the present, depth therapy asks different questions: When did they begin? With whom? What did they help you survive? This framework invites compassion and curiosity rather than shame.

Within a consistent therapeutic relationship, these insights aren't just understood cognitively—they're felt and experienced. Old relational expectations are reworked in real time, creating new experiences of safety, repair, and choice.

The resulting insight is profound: the old pattern made sense given its origins, so it no longer requires harsh self-judgment. And crucially, it no longer has to run the show. That shift opens the door to lasting transformation.

## Post 23: Depth Therapy Threads Post 2 (David, 8/12)
**Source**: David Drustrup
**Original Platform**: X/Twitter

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
Skill-building and quick fixes can be helpful. But therapy of depth, insight, and relationship asks a different question: Why do the same patterns keep returning? We look for the story behind the symptom.

Patterns are relational. They formed with important others, often in our families, and they inevitably appear in our other relationships too. Noticing them together—in the here-and-now—turns therapy into a living laboratory.

Our relationships are so powerful in shaping our patterns that it makes sense to practice a therapy that is itself relational. Research shows the relational aspect of therapy produces meaningful outcome differences.

The changes that happen in a therapeutic relationship get internalized as direct counterweights to earlier relational harm. Patients live the experience that things can be different and better.

Change that is understood from the inside tends to endure. It's often slower at first, but it sticks—because it's rooted in lived experience, not just new thoughts or skills.

#therapy #depthpsychology #relational #mentalhealth #PsiAN

### LinkedIn Version
Skill-building and solution-focused approaches have their place. But therapies of depth, insight, and relationship ask a fundamentally different question: Why do the same patterns keep returning?

We look for the story behind the symptom.

Patterns are inherently relational—they formed in relationships with important others, typically family members, and inevitably manifest in subsequent relationships. Recognizing them as they emerge in the therapeutic relationship itself transforms therapy into a living laboratory for change.

Given the relational origins of our patterns, it follows that relational therapy offers unique advantages. Research consistently demonstrates that the therapeutic relationship produces significant outcome differences independent of specific techniques.

The corrective experiences within therapy become internalized as counterweights to earlier relational injury. Patients don't just learn that change is possible—they live it.

Change understood from the inside tends to endure. The process may be slower initially, but it persists because it's grounded in lived experience rather than abstract concepts.

**Source**: David Drustrup
**Original Platform**: X/Twitter

### Instagram/Facebook/Threads Version
What does therapy of depth, insight, and relationship look like in practice?

We slow down. We track and experience emotion as deeply as possible. We listen for meanings held in the body and in memory—especially during early relationships, which tend to be the most formative.

We make room for the disavowed. We all show parts of ourselves and hide others, sometimes even from ourselves. When we hide parts in shame, we become less whole. Depth therapy attempts to reclaim these losses.

We find reasons for symptoms and patterns—usually dating back years or decades, often originating as ways to survive difficult circumstances. This understanding helps release their grip.

We pay close attention to the relationship unfolding in therapy. How we show, hide, laugh, anger, ignore, move toward, pull away—these illuminate who we are as social beings.

An attuned therapist helps us see these dynamics unfold, explores them with curiosity, and works toward healthier ways of relating—often healing old wounds in the process.

Therapy of depth is one of the hardest and most rewarding things you can do.

What does therapy of depth, insight, and relationship look like in practice?

**We slow down.** We track and experience emotion as fully as possible, listening for meanings held in the body and in memory—particularly from early relational experiences.

**We make room for the disavowed.** Everyone presents some aspects of themselves while hiding others, sometimes even from conscious awareness. Parts hidden in shame diminish our wholeness. Depth therapy works to reclaim what's been lost.

**We find the origins of patterns.** Symptoms and behavioral patterns typically began years or decades earlier, often as adaptive responses to difficult circumstances. Understanding their function helps release their grip on the present.

**We attend to the therapeutic relationship itself.** How we show, hide, approach, withdraw—these dynamics illuminate our relational patterns in real time. An attuned therapist notices these patterns, explores them with curiosity, and facilitates healthier ways of relating.

The Hidden Toll of "Taking Insurance" in Therapy

It sounds simple: pay for therapy with your insurance. But for many dedicated therapists, working with insurance companies is an administrative burden that takes time away from patient care.

The hassle: Hours spent fighting for authorization, mountains of claim forms, and reimbursement rates that barely cover practice costs.

The control: Invasive demands for private patient information and "medical necessity" requirements that dictate how and how long you can receive care—often overriding clinical judgment.

This is why many therapists choose to be self-pay only. It's not about greed; it's about protecting their energy to focus entirely on you and provide ethical care free from corporate interference.

Therapy should be about healing, not paperwork and profits.

The Hidden Toll of "Taking Insurance" in Therapy

The concept seems straightforward: use insurance to pay for therapy. But for many dedicated clinicians, working with insurance companies creates an administrative burden that directly impacts patient care.

**The administrative reality:** Hours spent seeking authorization, managing claim denials, and navigating reimbursement rates that often don't cover basic practice costs.

**The clinical intrusion:** Demands for detailed patient information, "medical necessity" requirements that dictate treatment duration and frequency—often superseding clinical judgment about what a particular patient needs.

Many excellent therapists choose self-pay practice not out of financial motivation, but to preserve their capacity to provide focused, ethical care without corporate interference. When administrative burden is reduced, more energy goes to the actual work of therapy.

The system asks therapists to choose between access and quality. That's a problem worth addressing collectively.

When a therapist chooses to stop accepting insurance, it's rarely a casual decision. It's often an act of self-preservation and a commitment to better client care.

The reality:

Undervalued work: Reimbursement rates often aren't sustainable, forcing therapists to see more patients than is clinically ideal just to make ends meet.

Invasive control: Insurance companies demand detailed private data and can interfere with treatment decisions.

The fight: Days spent on hold, appealing rejected claims, battling confusing systems that prioritize profit over patient wellbeing.

Going self-pay means a therapist can invest time in advanced training, consultation, and providing focused care—rather than fighting bureaucratic systems.

When a therapist decides to stop accepting insurance, it's rarely a casual business decision. For many, it's an act of professional sustainability and a commitment to providing quality care.

**The economic reality:** Reimbursement rates are often unsustainable, pushing therapists to see more patients than is clinically advisable to maintain viable practices.

**The privacy concerns:** Insurance companies require detailed patient information and increasingly influence treatment decisions that should be made collaboratively between therapist and client.

**The administrative burden:** Significant time spent on hold, appealing denials, and navigating opaque systems designed to minimize insurer payouts.

Self-pay practice allows clinicians to invest their resources in continued education, quality supervision, and focused clinical work rather than administrative battles.

This isn't about limiting access—it's about a broken system that forces difficult choices. PsiAN tracks these systemic issues to build the case for change.

Insurance in mental health: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

The good: Coverage can increase access to care for people who otherwise couldn't afford it.

The bad: Low reimbursement rates, prior authorization requirements that drain clinical time, ghost networks listing unavailable providers, and frequent claim denials.

The ugly: Insurers effectively dictate patient care—shorter sessions, capped frequency, pressure to assign diagnoses for billing purposes rather than clinical accuracy.

Treatments get interrupted or delayed. Documentation requirements consume hours. Clinical judgment gets sidelined by utilization rules. Companies intentionally make themselves difficult to work with, hoping providers give up on collecting payment.

PsiAN wants to make these profit-driven problems more visible. Use our Insurance Issue Tracker to log denials, delays, clawbacks, and credentialing issues. We're building collective power against these practices.

Mental health insurance: an honest assessment.

**The good:** Insurance coverage can meaningfully increase access for people who couldn't otherwise afford care.

**The bad:** Low reimbursement rates, prior authorization requirements consuming clinical time, ghost networks listing unavailable providers, and routine claim denials create substantial barriers.

**The concerning:** Insurers increasingly influence clinical decisions—mandating session length, capping frequency, creating pressure to assign diagnoses for billing rather than clinical accuracy.

The downstream effects: treatment interruptions and delays, documentation requirements consuming hours that should go to patient care, clinical judgment overridden by utilization management protocols. Some industry practices appear designed to discourage providers from pursuing legitimate reimbursement.

At PsiAN, we're working to document these systemic issues and build collective leverage for change. Our Insurance Issue Tracker collects data on denials, delays, clawbacks, and credentialing problems.

Self-pay therapy is a difficult decision for both clinicians and patients.

For clinicians, it's a weighing of reach versus the ability to practice responsibly: protect privacy, set session length and frequency based on need, maintain continuity, and prevent treatment from being shaped by insurer rules.

Therapists choose self-pay to protect patients from profit-focused insurers: fewer administrative hurdles, sustainable rates that allow time for extra patient support, less pressure to diagnose for payment purposes, and reduced data sharing.

If you're a patient, you may still be able to make self-pay work. During open enrollment, check your out-of-network benefits, deductibles, and HSA/FSA options. Ask potential therapists about sliding scale fees and superbills.

Plan ahead with your therapist to estimate frequency and duration, so you can budget accurately.

Self-pay therapy involves difficult calculations for clinicians and patients alike.

**For clinicians**, the decision weighs reach against the ability to practice with integrity: protecting privacy, determining session parameters based on clinical need rather than insurer rules, maintaining therapeutic continuity, and keeping treatment decisions within the therapeutic relationship.

Many choose self-pay specifically to shield patients from profit-driven insurance practices: fewer administrative obstacles, sustainable rates that permit attention to patient needs beyond billable hours, reduced pressure to assign diagnoses for payment purposes, and minimized data exposure.

**For patients**, self-pay may still be feasible with planning. During open enrollment, investigate out-of-network benefits, deductible structures, and HSA/FSA eligibility. Ask prospective therapists about sliding scale availability and superbill provision for potential reimbursement.

Working with your therapist to estimate treatment frequency and duration enables more accurate budgeting and reduces financial uncertainty.

## Post 30: Advocacy Power

Amplify the Silence: The Power of Advocacy in Mental Health

Mental health access isn't just a clinical issue—it's a societal one.

As therapists and allies, advocacy extends our work beyond the therapy room. It means actively working to ensure everyone can access quality care, regardless of systemic barriers.

Why is advocacy critical now?

Addressing systemic barriers: When policies restrict funding, limit coverage, or create deserts of care, they compound individual suffering. Advocacy addresses the structural side of mental health.

Ensuring access and equity: We must speak up against policies that create barriers. Advocating for thoughtful, human-centered policy is essential to closing the mental health gap.

Advocacy isn't partisan—it's caring for collective wellbeing. Join PsiAN today to help build a more just and supportive mental health landscape.

Amplify the Silence: The Power of Advocacy in Mental Health

Mental health access is not merely a clinical concern—it's a societal imperative.

For therapists and mental health advocates, our work extends beyond individual treatment. Advocacy means actively working to ensure that quality care is accessible regardless of socioeconomic status, geography, or systemic barriers.

**Why advocacy matters now:**

**Addressing structural barriers:** When policies restrict funding, limit insurance coverage, or create care deserts, they compound individual suffering on a population level. Advocacy addresses the systemic dimensions of mental health that no amount of individual therapy can solve.

**Advancing equity:** Progress requires speaking against policies that create barriers and advocating for human-centered approaches to mental healthcare policy. This is how we close the access gap.

Advocacy transcends political affiliation—it's fundamentally about collective wellbeing. If you share this perspective, PsiAN offers a community of like-minded professionals working toward systemic change.
