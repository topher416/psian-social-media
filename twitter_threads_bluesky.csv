"Human psychology is complex, nuanced, and largely unconscious. AI processes language but lacks intuition, lived experience, and the capacity to grasp human emotional life. Here's why that matters for therapy:",image,[IMAGE_01],2026-01-21 9:00 pm,"AI can mimic understanding, but it can't truly comprehend the contradictions, defenses, and deep patterns that drive human behavior. These require a trained human mind to recognize and work through.","At @PsiikiAN, we advocate for therapies of depth, insight, and relationship—approaches that resolve underlying conflicts, not just manage symptoms.","The goal isn't quick fixes. It's profound personal growth, self-understanding, and healthier ways of relating. That requires human connection.","If you're a therapist who believes in this work, join us. Link in bio.",
"Thinking about AI for mental health? Here's what you should know about the risks, especially around deeper psychological work:",image,[IMAGE_02],2026-01-27 9:00 pm,"AI can mimic empathy, but it can't access the unconscious—the hidden motivations and conflicts driving your feelings. This leads to surface-level ""solutions"" at best.","In a crisis, AI responses can be inadequate or even dangerous. There's no trained human judgment assessing risk in real-time.","True relational healing requires a human relationship. The therapeutic bond itself is part of the medicine. AI can't replicate that.","Plus, data privacy concerns are real. Your deepest struggles shouldn't be training data. Learn more at @PsiikiAN",

"Mental health apps are convenient, but are they safe? Let's talk about privacy risks most people don't know about:",image,[IMAGE_04],2026-02-03 9:00 pm,"Apps can't replace the nuanced connection of human therapy. They might help with basics, but they're not therapists.","Here's the bigger issue: many mental health apps operate OUTSIDE of HIPAA. That means fewer protections for your sensitive data.","Reports show apps sharing your mental health symptoms, personal details, and usage patterns with data brokers and advertisers. Your struggles become their product.","The profit motive can overshadow privacy. Before using any mental health app, research their data practices. And remember: human connection heals. @PsiikiAN",

"""Gold standard"" therapy. Sounds definitive, right? But the term primarily serves insurance companies—not patients. Here's what research actually shows:",image,[IMAGE_08],2026-02-17 9:00 pm,"Recent research called ""The treatment-prevalence paradox"" found something striking: more access to short-term therapy hasn't reduced depression rates. More treatment, same outcomes.","This isn't surprising to depth therapists. Problems that developed over years or decades can't be resolved in a few weeks. That's common sense.","Even researchers who support short-term methods admit: benefits are often modest, rarely sustained, and don't translate well to real-world settings.","Therapies of depth, insight, and relationship address deeper patterns, creating lasting transformation. Patients keep improving for YEARS after treatment ends.","The ""gold standard"" label is misinformation that benefits insurers at patients' expense. @PsiikiAN #TherapyThatSticks"
"Thinking about a therapy app? Before you sign up, here are 6 things worth knowing:",image,[IMAGE_09],2026-02-18 9:00 pm,"1. BetterHelp, TalkSpace, etc. are tech companies first.

That's what enables real work.","3. Effective therapy requires relationship and trust. Hard to build with anonymous, potentially rotating ""therapists."" 4. Your data may be shared with third parties.","5. Apps can't handle serious crises and often have limited scope. 6.
